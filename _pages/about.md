We are *Causal Perception and Reasoning* research group based in HCMC, Vietnam. Our group's mission is built on a simple but powerful premise: true AI must move beyond correlation-based Perception (recognizing *what* is in the data) to achieve *Causal Reasoning* (understanding *why* it happens). This focus on causality is the common thread that connects our diverse research areas. We don't just build models that see; we build models that understand.

**Our Core Research**

1.  **Causal Emotion & Video Understanding**
    * Go beyond *what* emotion is shown to understand *why* it's happening.
    * Model the **causal triggers** for emotional responses in videos.
    * Analyze the **causal influence** one person's expression has on another.

2.  **Document Image Analysis & Understanding**
    * Treat documents as logical, structured artifacts, not just pixels.
    * Infer the **causal structure** and *why* a layout is designed in a certain way.
    * Model the logical and causal relationships between text, tables, and figures.

3.  **AI in Healthcare**
    * Focus on **causal inference** for trustworthy, safe medical diagnostics.
    * Identify true **causal biomarkers** for diseases from images and patient data.
    * Separate disease *causes* from mere *correlations* to improve diagnostic accuracy.

4.  **Foundations of Causal Reasoning**
    * Develop novel **neuro-symbolic** architectures that bridge perception and logic.
    * Build models capable of **counterfactual reasoning** (*what-if* scenarios).
    * Design new algorithms for **causal discovery** from complex data like video.

      
We are actively growing and seeking passionate collaborators to build the future of causal AI.

* Prospective Students (PhD, Master, UG): [Join us](/join-us) if you're driven to explore the *why* behind AI, not just the *what*.
* Academic Partners: Let's collaborate on fundamental research and solve real-world challenges in [healthcare, document AI, and video understanding](/research).
