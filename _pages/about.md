We are *Causal Perception and Reasoning* research group based in HCMC, Vietnam. Our group's mission is built on a simple but powerful premise: true AI must move beyond correlation-based Perception (recognizing *what* is in the data) to achieve genuine *Causal Reasoning* (understanding *why* it happens). This focus on causality is the common thread that connects our diverse research areas. We don't just build models that see; we build models that understand.

We are actively growing and seeking passionate collaborators to build the future of causal AI.
* Prospective Students (PhD, Master, UG): [Join us](/join-us) if you're driven to explore the "why" behind AI, not just the "what".
* Academic Partners: Let's collaborate on fundamental research and solve real-world challenges in [healthcare, document AI, and video understanding](/research).
