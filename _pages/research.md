### Affective computing

{% details Here are some topics that we are working on %}

* Cognitive load, concentration recognition with image and/or biological signals (EEG, ECG, EMG, ...).

* Graph-based contextual emotion recognition: video-based (spatial context, _temporal context_).

* Wearable-device based complex emotion recognition: biological signals (EEG, ECG, EMG, ...).
